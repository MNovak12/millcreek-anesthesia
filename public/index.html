          <p>Millcreek Anesthesia was founded in 1991 by a group of eight Physician
          Anesthesiologists who had been practicing together at St. Mark's Hospital.
          </p>

          <p>Millcreek Anesthesia remains an all physician group that has now grown to
          include thirty-two Board Certified or Board Eligible Anesthesiologists. We
          have a long history of being the exclusive providers of quality anesthetic care
          at St. Mark's Hospital, St Markâ€™s Outpatient Surgery Center and Lone Peak
          Hospital in partnership with your surgeon, obstetrician or care provider.</p>

      <h1>What To Expect</h1>
      <p>There are three main types of anesthetics that may be administered by your
anesthesiologist for your surgery.</p>
      <h3>Monitored Anesthetic Care</h3>
      <p>You will be given intravenous sedation and pain medicine to help you feel
relaxed and reduce pain. Your surgeon will then administer an injection of
numbing medicine to block pain in the local area of your surgery. Although
you are not completely asleep, it is likely you will not remember the surgery.</p>

      <p>Your anesthesiologist will remain with you and continuously monitor your
status to ensure your comfort and safety.</p>

      <h3>Regional Anesthesia</h3>
      <p>An injection of numbing medicine is administered by your anesthesiologist to
block nerves. This may include blocking the nerves to an extremity or a
larger area. An epidural block for childbirth is another example of a regional
anesthetic. Regional anesthesia may also be combined with sedation or a
general anesthetic. This type of anesthetic is also used to provide pain
control after the surgery when long lasting medications are used or a
catheter is left in place after the surgery.</p>
      
      <h3>General Anesthesia</h3>
      <p>You are completely unconscious and asleep for the surgery.</p>
      
      <h3>At Home</h3>
      <p>You will be asked to fast before your surgery so your stomach is empty when
your anesthetic is administered. Frequently, you will be asked to have
nothing to eat or drink starting at midnight on the day of your surgery. Even
if your surgery is scheduled for later in the day, please follow the fasting
instructions you receive at your pre-op visit as your actual surgery time may
change.</p>
      
      <h3>At St. Mark's Hospital</h3>
      <p>You will be transported from Ambulatory Care to the Operating Room in a
hospital bed or stretcher. You will meet your anesthesiologist in the Pre-
operative Holding Area. We will ask you questions about your medical,
anesthetic and surgical histories. We will discuss your specific anesthetic plan
and answer all questions you may have. You will also meet your Operating
Room nurse and have the opportunity to speak with your surgeon or their
assistant before you are transported to the operating room.</p>
